		<h2> Computer Hardware, Software, and Implementations</h2>
			<br>
			
			<p> &nbsp In the world of technology, a computer is the most crucial part amongst any other things.
			We came from dominating the world of nature to playing god and simulating the idea of creation. 
			The closest we’ve ever been to being a god is the power of creating and disassembling - something
			very evident in modern society where we can create anything we want and yet destroy something we 
			don’t like. With that said, the power of creation humanity wields can be harnessed with just a 
			simple device - the computer. Built to foster imagination and regulate creation. The computer is 
			composed of two parts - all geared toward simplicity and efficiency. The first part is composed of 
			hardwares. These are physical components that simulate the world of computers. It holds the power 
			computers have and the ideas that are built within them. </p>
			<li>The CPU is the physical brain of the computer. It processes ideas and automatically presents 
			you the world of possibilities. It orders the other components to do what you want it to do and act
			the way you want it to.</li>
			<li>The RAM is the physical representation of what a memory is. However, contrary to what human memory
			does, the RAM acts as a portal that pulls present ideas forward. Among the many computations that the 
			computer does, the RAM prioritizes the idea that the user wants manifested first. It doesn’t hold the 
			memory for a long time as its job is to only prioritize what the user wants to see done first.</li>
			<li>Motherboard, Drive, and graphics card. These components holds the power to connect each component
			with each other. They synchronize, harmonize, and execute orders that prioritizes running the computer
			and allowing users to monopolize the entirety of the computer to their advantage.</li>
			<p>However, the computer isn’t exactly the thing that makes ideas to fruition. It’s just the vessel. 
			The entire “creation and application” idea and thing came from the softwares that manage the components
			of the computer. If the hardware is the body, one can consider that the software is the consciousness of
			the computer. The one that breathes life into the computer and says “yes” to the things the user wants to
			be done. There are three types of software types:</p>
			<li>System software. The consciousness that allows the computer to run and connect with the hardwares within.
			It also regulates and manages the computer to do what must be done to keep itself alive, secured, and stable.
			In human terms, it’s the veins within the body that keeps each of our organs connected.</li>
			<li>Application software. Also known as “the app”, it holds access to the user’s ideas. It is also where 
			other forms of “creation” can manifest. This is where most users bolster their own curiosities and fosters 
			their own ideas through access of virtual tools.</li>
			<li>Programming software. The consciousness that controls and manipulates the computer to think and act.
			The one consciousness that weilds the power of dismembering and refiguring the concept of a computer however 
			they wish.</li>
